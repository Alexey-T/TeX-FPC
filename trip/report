This directory suggests how to perform the trip test as described in the
tripman file.

Step 0.
mv the trip directory to the tex directory, and cd to the trip directory.
Copy the file trip.tex from the tex directory to the trip directory:
cp ../trip.tex .

Step 1. make and test trip.tfm
$ pltotf ../trip.pl trip.tfm

'160 '161 '162 '163 '164 '165 '202.
$ tftopl trip.tfm tmp.pl

'160 '161 '162 '163 '164 '165 '202.
$ diff tmp.pl ../trip.pl
no news are good news!

Step 2 prepare tex.ch with the handy mktrip script.
$ cd ..
$ mktrip
37493
...
$ itgl tex.web tex.ch
This is TANGLE-FPC, 3rd ed.
...

Save initex to you bin directory:
mv initex ~/bin/

$ cd -

Step 3
$ initex
This is TeX-FPC, 3rd ed. (INITEX)
**
Please type the name of your input file or Control-D.
**\input trip
...

Save trip.log:
$ mv trip.log tripin.log

Report the differences:
$ diff ../tripin.log tripin.log  >diff_tripin.log
Step 4
$ initex
This is TeX-FPC, 3rd ed. (INITEX)
** &trip  trip
! Bad number (-7).
...
Copy the screen output to trip.fot.
Report the differences:
$ diff ../trip.log trip.log  >diff_trip.log
$ diff ../trip.fot trip.fot  >diff_trip.fot
Note: The files diff_.. are distributed in this directory.
Note: I copied the terminal window to create the trip.fot. It contains
both what I typed and what tex printed.

Step 6
The file options relieves you from typing the options manually.

$ dvitype trip.dvi trip.typ <options
This is DVItype-FPC, 3rd ed.
Output level (default=4, ? for help): Starting page (default=*): Maximum number of pages (default=1000000): Assumed device resolution in pixels per inch (default=300/1): New magnification (default=0 to keep the old one): $ 
The file diff_trip.typ contains the differences of my run to Knuth's.
$ diff ../trip.typ trip.typ >diff_trip.typ
