How to install xdvi for TeX-GPC:

Get the source from
   https://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/xdvi/xdvi-22.85.tar.gz
It unpacks into xdvi-22.85.

Edit config reflecting your binary directory, your man directory
(i. e. a directory you have write permissions and has a subdirectory
man1) and the resolution of your printer and then switch to xdvi-22.84
and run
../config && make clean && make && make install

Unfortunately this neither works for NetBSD nor for Mac OS X.
For NetBSD use this:
../config && make clean && make && ../load && make install

For Mac OS X use this:
Instead replace the configure script in xdvi-22.84 with macconfigure,
and replace xdvi.h with macxdvi.h.

The xdvi is configured soley by DVIPSconf/XDvi, move XDvi to DVIPSconf.

You might want to change /etc/man.conf to include your private man pages.
I boldly replaced the line
_default        /usr/{share,X11R6,pkg,local}/man/
to
_default        /usr/{helbig,share,X11R6,pkg,local}/man/

For whatever reason, I couldn't make configure work on Mac OS X. Please help!
