2008-07-21: Change files for tex and friends, shell scripts to build
            a Pascal only implementation of TeX.

            TeX-bugs fixed:
	    (1) TeX warns you about an underful box if the last line
	    of Paragraph contains discardables only.  I discovered
	    this bug while trying to prove the line breaking code.
	    I reported to Mrs. Beeton. But the checkers didn't seem
	    to understand my request. They replied: An empty box
            triggers the underful box warning as designed. 
            But this is not, what I questioned. But I do question,
	    that TeX leaves an empty box as the last line of a
	    paragraph. At least it should contain the \parfilskip
	    glue. Well, I fixed it by protecting \parfilskip from
	    being discarded. By the way, this is one of those bugs
	    you won't find by testing.

	    (2) TeX flushes now and then extension and area of input
	    file names.  Igor Liferenko reported this bug on
	    2020-10-29, more than twelve years later.

2008-09-07: MetaPost, dvips, xdvi, polytonic greek fonts added.
	    Less than two month suffice for TeX-GPC to grow autonomous:
	    To typeset, preview and print technical papers containing
	    figures is all covered by the components of TeX-GPC.

	    Btw., this turned out to be important for me. The latest
	    Mac OS version running on my 2009 imac is OS X 11.
	    MacTeX 2020 runs on 10.15 or newer.

	    TeX-GPC does buffered write for the dvi file. This
	    triples the speed.  To process tex.tex web2c needed
	    7.54s, TeX-FPC 11.40s. Speed is important for the
	    preview-edit cycle.

2010-03-16: The 2nd edition builds and runs on Mac OS 10.2, it includes
	    a directory "tech" that shows how to construct tex with
	    the German hyphenation table and the package german
	    style from Bernd Raichle.  Now TeX-GPC contains everything
	    you need to typeset, preview, and print German books,
	    as I did! (Helbig: Analysis 0, Ein logischer Einstieg
	    in die Analysis). When Germans write the word they hear
	    when Knuth says "TeX" they write "tech".

	    Now TeX-GPC is compatible to newer versions of GPC as
	    suggested by Martin Monperrus. Louis Rivera kindly
	    reported some problems relating to different versions
	    of the compiler.

	    Joachim Kuebart reported: If the first input line
	    contains spaces only, TeX-GPC might loop. In fact TeX-GPC
	    will not loop since it accidently exploits the fact,
	    that the memory is zeroed out when initialized by  Unix.
	    But nevertheless it is a bug.

2010-05-26: 2nd edition, first fix: tangle.p forgotten.
	    Aside from tangle.p the same as above.

2014-06-29: 3rd edition, based on Knuth's dististribution  from
	    Jan. 2014.  The change files of this edition are to be
            applied to  TeX version 3.14159265, MF version 2.7182818.

2015-09-30: Update to macOS 10.11 broke GPC and therefore TeX-GPC
            as well.  Helpless, sad, hoping for a revival of GPC.

2019-02-22: 1st edition of TeX-FPC. Date fixed at 1776-07-14.

2019-03-04: fixing three bugs of 1st. edition, all reported by Joachim.
	    The shell script tgl tried to launch good old GPC.  An
	    extra space in tex.ch corrupted the change file.  In
	    tex.ch a '\marke G' waited to be replaced by '\marke X'.

2020-11-25: 2nd edition. All features recreated! Finally arrived the state
	    of 2008-09-07. Exhausted but happy!

	    Igor Liferenko reported another bug in TeX: An extra space
	    is printed in the log file and the last line is not terminated
	    when the user switched to \batchmode during error recovery.
	    TeX-FPC fixes both noisances.

	    Realizing that TeX-FPC is the only pure Pascal distribution,
	    I decided that my personal preferences are not worthwhile
	    to clutter up TeX-FPC, since I can reinstall them
	    whenever I want them. My wishes are: Don't ignore trailing
	    spaces of input lines, don't ignore leading spaces of
	    the first input line. Don't print extra empty lines on
	    the terminal, when entering a file interactively.  These
	    regressions leads us back to IBM's fixed length records
	    and punching cards, when the user could not control the
	    length of a line.

future: Bugs that remain to be fixed:
	    This one-liner loops:
	         \def\par{\endgroup\par} \def\a#1{#1} \a\par

            Whatever you enter during error recovery, you cannot convince
	    TeX to forgive your faux pas and continue processing the rest
	    of the file.

2021-02:    3rd edition. Will Senn and Dave Jarvis pointed out some ambiguities
            in the README file. I'll took their comments and questions to
            improve the wordings in the README file and some of TeX's error
            messages.

            The minimal installation does not care for the .pk fonts. They will
            be created on demand by the dvi drivers. (dvips and xdvi)

2021-04:    4th edition. Joachim found some typos in README and helped to
	    fix the WEB macros.
