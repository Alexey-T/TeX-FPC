How to install xdvi for TeX-FPC:

Get the source from
   https://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/xdvi/xdvi-22.86.tar.gz
It unpacks into xdvi-22.86.

Edit the file config reflecting your binary directory, your man directory
(i. e. a directory you have write permissions and has a subdirectory
man1) and the resolution of your printer and then switch to xdvi-22.86
and run
../config && make clean && make && make install

Unfortunately this neither works for NetBSD nor for Mac OS X.
For NetBSD use this:
../config && make clean && make && ../load && make install

For Mac OS X it gets more involved:
gcc -g creates files with the suffix .dSYM. The configure script
then takes .dSYM as the suffix of executables, and thus breaks.

The libraries in Mac OS X have the suffix .dynlib which breaks the
configure script.

See the file configdiff for the changes.

A third error is to be fixed in xdvi.h, where symbol _XOPEN_SOURCE
is defined.  Remove the line, since the definition of _XOPEN_SOURCE
causes NSIG to be not defined, which breaks signal.h.

To fix the configure file either apply the changes in configdiff
to it or replace it by the file macconfigure.

Ignore the install-data error from make install.

The file $HOME/Xdvi will be read by xdvi.
An example configuration file is Xdvi. 

Install the directory mfware from Knuth's distribution in tex-fpc.
Build and install mfware/gftopk and cp dvips/MakeTeXPK to your bin
directory. xdvi uses these programs to create bitmap pixel fonts~.nnnpk
on demand.

You might want to change /etc/man.conf to include your private man pages.
I boldly replaced the line
_default        /usr/{share,X11R6,pkg,local}/man/
to
_default        /usr/{helbig,share,X11R6,pkg,local}/man/

enjoy
